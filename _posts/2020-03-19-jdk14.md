title: JDK 14 Security Enhancements
---

[JDK 14](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/14/) has been released! As with my
previous blogs for [JDK 13](https://seanjmullan.org/blog/2019/08/05/jdk13)
and [JDK 12](https://seanjmullan.org/blog/2019/03/19/jdk12), I
have compiled a list of what I think are the most interesting and useful
security enhancements in this release.  I have also grouped
them into appropriate categories (crypto, TLS, etc) which should make
it easier to find out what has changed in each specific area.
The [JDK 14 Release Notes](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/14-relnote-issues-5809570.html)
also contain details on these and other enhancements.

2. [Crypto](#crypto)
3. [TLS](#tls)
4. [XML Signature](#xml-signature)
5. [Tools](#tools)

### General

-   The deprecated `java.security.acl` APIs have been removed

    These APIs were initially deprecated in Java SE 9 and marked for
    removal in Java SE 10. These APIs have been considered legacy for
    a long time. Applications should use the `java.security.Policy` and
    related APIs instead.

-   New Amazon Root CAs have been added

    Four new Amazon Root Certificate Authorities (CAs) have been added to
    the JDK `cacerts` keystore. The Distinguished Names of the CAs are:

    + CN=Amazon Root CA 1, O=Amazon, C=US

    + CN=Amazon Root CA 2, O=Amazon, C=US

    + CN=Amazon Root CA 3, O=Amazon, C=US

    + CN=Amazon Root CA 4, O=Amazon, C=US

-   New LuxTrust Root CA has been added

    One new LuxTrust Root Certificate Authority (CA) has been added to the
    JDK `cacerts` keystore. The Distinguished Name of the CA is:

    + CN=LuxTrust Global Root 2, O=LuxTrust S.A., C=LU


### Crypto

-   Legacy elliptic curves have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release

    The implementations of 47 named elliptic curves in the
    `SunEC` provider have been deprecated. These curves are not implemented
    using modern techniques and many of them are no longer recommended by
    standard groups. The implementations of these curves will be removed
    or replaced in a future release of the JDK.

    See the
    [Deprecated Legacy Curves](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/security/oracle-providers.html#GUID-091BF58C-82AB-4C9C-850F-1660824D5254__LEGACY-CURVES-RETAINED-FOR-COMPATIBILITY)
    section of the JDK Providers Doc for the complete list of affected
    curves.

-   Legacy elliptic curves have been disabled by default in TLS, CertPath,
    and Signed JARs

    Related to the previous issue, these curves have also been disabled
    by default if used in TLS protocol exchanges, certification paths, or
    signed JARs. A new security property named jdk.disabled.namedCurves
    has been added to the `java.security` configuration file that
    contains the names of the disabled curves. Certificates or protocol
    exchanges using these curves will be blocked or negotiated to use
    other acceptable curves.

    Below is the definition of the property in the `java.security` file:

        #
        # This property contains a list of disabled EC Named Curves that can be included
        # in the jdk.[tls|certpath|jar].disabledAlgorithms properties.  To include this
        # list in any of the disabledAlgorithms properties, add the property name as
        # an entry.
        jdk.disabled.namedCurves = secp112r1, secp112r2, secp128r1, secp128r2, \
            secp160k1, secp160r1, secp160r2, secp192k1, secp192r1, secp224k1, \
            secp224r1, secp256k1, sect113r1, sect113r2, sect131r1, sect131r2, \
            sect163k1, sect163r1, sect163r2, sect193r1, sect193r2, sect233k1, \
            sect233r1, sect239k1, sect283k1, sect283r1, sect409k1, sect409r1, \
            sect571k1, sect571r1, X9.62 c2tnb191v1, X9.62 c2tnb191v2, \
            X9.62 c2tnb191v3, X9.62 c2tnb239v1, X9.62 c2tnb239v2, X9.62 c2tnb239v3, \
            X9.62 c2tnb359v1, X9.62 c2tnb431r1, X9.62 prime192v2, X9.62 prime192v3, \
            X9.62 prime239v1, X9.62 prime239v2, X9.62 prime239v3, brainpoolP256r1, \
            brainpoolP320r1, brainpoolP384r1, brainpoolP512r1

-   The `OracleUCrypto` provider has been deprecated for removal

    The [`OracleUCrypto` provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/security/oracle-providers.html#GUID-D08B5350-6653-4FC6-B350-2B009A9E7FD6)
    is supported only on the Solaris platform and provides access to the
    algorithms in the native Solaris Ucrypto cryptographic library. It
    has been deprecated as part of
    [JEP 362](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/362) (Deprecate the Solaris
    SPARC Ports). The provider will be removed from a future JDK release
    when the Solaris ports are officially removed.

### TLS

-   Standard Names for Signature Schemes and Named Groups defined

    Standard names have been defined for TLS signature schemes and named
    groups in the Standard Algorithm Names Specification. This improves
    compatibility by providing standard names for signature schemes and
    elliptic curves which can be specified by applications in various
    APIs and properties.

    Below is a snapshot of the names from the
    [Signature Schemes](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/specs/security/standard-names.html#signature-schemes) and
    [Named Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/specs/security/standard-names.html#named-groups)
    sections of the Java Security Standard Algorithm Names specification.

-   `SSLv2Hello` and `SSLv3` have been removed from the default enabled TLS protocols

    As a further strengthening measure, `SSLv2Hello` and `SSLv3` have been
    removed from the default list of enabled TLS protocols. *Note* that
    `SSLv3` had already been restricted by default as it is included
    in the `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms` security property in the
    system-wide `java.security` configuration file. With this change,
    `SSLv3` is not enabled by default even if it is removed from the
    `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms` security property.

### XML Signature

-   XML Signature implementation updated to Apache Santuario v2.1.4

    The XML Signature implementation in the JDK has been updated to
    version 2.1.4 of [Apache Santuario XML Security for Java](https://santuario.apache.org/javareleasenotes.html),
    which it is based on.

    With this update, one new system property has been added:
    `com.sun.org.apache.xml.internal.security.parser.pool-size`. This can
    be set to the pool size of the internal `DocumentBuilder` cache used
    to process XML Signatures. The default value is 20. Setting this
    property may improve performance depending on the application's use
    case.

### Tools

-   The default algorithms for `keytool -keyalg` have been removed

    Key algorithm defaults are no longer supported and `keytool` now
    exits with an error if a specific algorithm is not specified using
    the `-keyalg` option when generating keys with the `-genkeypair`
    or `-genseckey` commands. 

    Here is an example output of running the command:

        $ keytool -genkeypair 
        Enter keystore password:  
        keytool error: java.lang.Exception: The -keyalg option must be specified.
