title: JDK 17 Security Enhancements
---

[JDK 17](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/17/) was released on September 14, 2021! As with
my previous [blogs](https://seanjmullan.org/blog/), I
have compiled a list of what I think are the most interesting and useful
security enhancements in this release.  I have also grouped
them into appropriate categories (crypto, TLS, etc) which should make
it easier to find out what has changed in each specific area.
The [JDK 17 release notes](https://jdk.java.net/17/release-notes)
also contain further details on these and other enhancements.

Probably the most significant security related change in JDK 17 is
[JEP 411: Deprecate the Security Manager for Removal](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/411).
JDK 17 begins that process by deprecating a number of Security Manager APIs
and adding run time warnings for applications using the Security Manager.
See the [Security Manager](#security-manager) section below for further details.

Also, three other important JDK 17 features that are not part of the security
libraries area but have beneficial security benefits include:

- [JEP 403: Strongly Encapsulate JDK Internals](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/403)

  With JEP 403, JDK 17 continues to strengthen the strong encapsulation
  of JDK internals by disabling the command line switch to
  enable relaxed strong encapsulation. Instead you must use the
  `--add-opens` or `--add-exports` command-line options to individually
  open/export packages if necessary.

- [JEP 409: Sealed Classes](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/409)

  Sealed classes allow you to restrict what classes are allowed to
  extend or implement a specific class. This has obvious security
  benefits as it can be used to prevent unauthorized implementations of the
  class.

- [JEP 415: Context-Specific Deserialization Filters](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/415)

  [Deserialization filters](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/290) were introduced
  in JDK 9 and allow applications and libraries to validate incoming
  serialized streams before deserializing them. This can be done statically
  via security properties or dynamically via a new `ObjectInputFilter` API
  that applies to the `ObjectInputStream`.

  JEP 415 improves on this feature by introducing filter factories which
  can be used to apply different filters depending on the object stream.

### Crypto

-   __Support KWP in addition to KW__

    The `SunJCE` provider now supports the AES Key Wrap With Padding (KWP) mode.
    Also, the AES Key Wrap mode (KW) has been enhanced to support encryption
    of keys (in addition to wrapping), and custom IVs and padding schemes.

    These standard modes are designed to protect cryptographic keys and
    are defined in [NIST SP 800-38F](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-38f/final).

    Use these modes in your Java application with the `javax.crypto.Cipher`
    API with the algorithm transformations `"AES/KWP/NoPadding"`,
    `"AES/KW/PKCS5Padding"` or `"AES/KW/NoPadding"`.

    Alternatively, you can specify `"AESWrap"` as the `Cipher` algorithm
    which is equivalent to KW mode with NoPadding, or `"AESWrapPad"` which
    is equivalent to KWP mode with NoPadding.
 
    Issue: [JDK-8248268](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8248268)

-   __JCE doesn't provide any class to handle RSA private key in PKCS#1__

    The `"RSA"` implementation of `KeyFactory` can now generate private and
    public keys from a PKCS#1 encoding (in addition to PKCS#8).

    Issue: [JDK-8023980](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8023980)

-   __Add ChaCha20 and Poly1305 support to SunPKCS11 provider__

    The `SunPKCS11` provider now supports the ChaCha20 and Poly1305 stream
    ciphers, if the underlying PKCS#11 implementation also supports them.

    Issue: [JDK-8255410](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8255410)

### PKI

-   __Add support for RFC 8954: Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Nonce Extension__

    Support for the [OCSP Nonce Extension](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8954/)
    has been added to the PKIX implementation. The Nonce extension can help
    prevent replay attacks where a previous good OCSPResponse for a certificate
    has not expired but the status of the certificate has changed (for example,
    it is now revoked) and the prior good OCSPResponse can be replayed.

    For compatibility reasons, the extension is not enabled by default, but
    can be enabled by setting the `jdk.security.certpath.ocspNonce` system
    property to `true`. If not enabled, the default JDK implementation uses
    a time-based approach as specified by
    [RFC 5019](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5019#section-7.1).

    Issue: [JDK-8256895](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8256895)

-   __Java should support GET OCSP calls__

    The JDK PKIX implementation now uses HTTP GET (instead of POST) to submit
    OCSP requests if the request is less than 255 bytes. Using GET allows
    requests to be cached which can improve performance.

    Issue: [JDK-8179503](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8179503)

-   __New HARICA root CA certificates added__

    Two new root CA certificates owned by [HARICA](https://www.harica.gr/)
    have been added to the `cacerts` keystore:

    1. HARICA Root CA 2015

       This [root certificate](https://crt.sh/?id=12731951) has the following distinguished name:

       <div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; text-indent:25px; padding:10px 0;">
       <code>
       CN=Hellenic Academic and Research Institutions RootCA 2015, O=Hellenic Academic and Research Institutions Cert. Authority, L=Athens, C=GR
       </code>
       </div>

    2. HARICA ECC Root CA 2015

       This [root certificate](https://crt.sh/?id=12729857) has the following distinguished name:

       <div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; text-indent:25px; padding:10px 0;">
       <code>
       CN=Hellenic Academic and Research Institutions ECC RootCA 2015, O=Hellenic Academic and Research Institutions Cert. Authority, L=Athens, C=GR
       </code>
       </div>

    These root certificates have also been added to the `cacerts` keystore in
    Oracle's JDK 16.0.1, 11.0.11, 8u291, and 7u301 releases.

    Issue: [JDK-8256421](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8256421)

### TLS

-   __Configurable extensions with system properties__

    TLS interoperability issues can sometimes occur if an implementation
    does not properly handle TLS extensions that it does not support. To
    help workaround these issues, two new system properties have been
    introduced that allow you to customize the extensions that
    are not enabled (i.e. disabled) when establishing a TLS connection.

    The system properties apply to the client
    (`jdk.tls.client.disableExtensions`) or the server
    (`jdk.tls.server.disableExtensions`). The value of the property is
    a comma separated list of [standard TLS extension names](https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-extensiontype-values/tls-extensiontype-values.xhtml). For example:

    `java -Djdk.tls.client.disabledExtensions="status_request,signature_algorithms_cert" ...`

    Issue: [JDK-8217633](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8217633)

### Kerberos

-   __Deprecate 3DES and RC4 in Kerberos__

    3DES and RC4 Kerberos encryption types have now been disabled
    by default. Both 3DES and RC4 are weak encryption algorithms that should
    not be used. The Kerberos 3DES and RC4 encryption types are officially
    deprecated in [RFC 8429](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8429).

    By default the `des3-hmac-sha1` and `rc4-hmac` encryption types are now
    disabled, but can be re-enabled, at your own risk, by setting the
    `allow_weak_crypto` property to true in the `krb5.conf` configuration file.
    However, note that will also re-enable other weak encryption types that
    are already disabled such as `des-cbc-crc` and `des-cbc-md5`. Alternatively,
    set the `default_tkt_enctypes`, `default_tgs_enctypes`, and
    `permitted_enctypes` properties to the encryption types that are allowed.

    Issue: [JDK-8139348](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8139348)

### XML Signature

-   __Add SignatureMethodParameterSpec subclass for RSASSA-PSS params__

    A new class named [`javax.xml.crypto.dsig.spec.RSAPSSParameterSpec`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.xml.crypto/javax/xml/crypto/dsig/spec/RSAPSSParameterSpec.html)
    has been added to the XML Signature API and can be used to specify
    parameters for the RSASSA-PSS signature algorithm. Also, a new String
    constant for the signature algorithm ([RSA_PSS](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.xml.crypto/javax/xml/crypto/dsig/SignatureMethod.html#RSA_PSS)) has been defined.

    The new API takes a `java.security.spec.PSSParameterSpec` as the
    input parameter.

    Issue: [JDK-8259575](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8259575)

-   __Disable SHA-1 XML Signatures__

    XML Signatures that contain SHA-1 based digest or signature
    algorithms are now disabled by default. SHA-1 is a weak digest algorithm
    that is no longer recommended for digest and signature algorithms.
    Validation of XML signatures that violate this constraint will fail.

    If necessary, and at their own risk, users can re-enable SHA-1 by
    modifying or overriding the `jdk.xml.dsig.secureValidationPolicy`
    security property defined in the `java.security` configuration file.

    Issue: [JDK-8259709](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8259709)

-   __Enable XML Signature secure validation mode by default__

    The XML Signature secure validation mode has been enabled by default.
    Previously, applications had to explicitly enable this mode by
    setting the `org.jcp.xml.dsig.secureValidation` property to `true` with
    the `javax.xml.crypto.XMLCryptoContext.setProperty()` method, or by
    running the code with a `SecurityManager` enabled. 

    The secure validation mode provides additional protection against
    XML Signatures that contain potentially hostile content, use weak
    algorithms, or contain constructs that may cause denial-of-service.
    Currently, this mode enforces the following restrictions:

    - Forbids the use of XSLT transforms
    - Restricts the number of SignedInfo or Manifest Reference elements to 30 or less
    - Restricts the number of Reference transforms to 5 or less
    - Forbids the use of MD5 signature or MAC algorithms
    - Forbids the use of SHA-1 signature algorithms
    - Ensures that Reference IDs are unique to help prevent signature wrapping attacks
    - Forbids Reference URIs of type http, https, or file
    - Does not allow a RetrievalMethod element to reference another RetrievalMethod element
    - Forbids RSA or DSA keys less than 1024 bits and EC keys less than 224 bits

    For more information about this mode see the
    [XML Signature Secure Validation Mode](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/security/java-xml-digital-signature-api-overview-and-tutorial.html#GUID-8618C294-3BFE-45C3-9A1E-C4629E337E68)
    in the XML Signature API Overview and Tutorial.

    Issue: [JDK-8259801](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8259801)

### Security Manager

-   __Deprecate the Security Manager for Removal__

    In JDK 17, the Security Manager has been deprecated for removal. This
    includes the `java.lang.SecurityManager` API and several APIs related
    to the Security Manager -- see
    [the *Deprecate APIs for removal* section of the JEP](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/411#Deprecate-APIs-for-removal)
    for a full list of impacted APIs.

    There are several reasons why the Security Manager is being deprecated,
    and these are covered in more detail in
    [the *Motivation* section of the JEP](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/411#Motivation).

    Note that the Security Manager will still be fully supported in JDK 17 --
    however warnings will be emitted at run time if a Security Manager is
    enabled -- this will help alert users and developers of the deprecation and
    prepare for the future removal.
