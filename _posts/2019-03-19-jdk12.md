title: JDK 12 Security Enhancements
---

[JDK 12](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/12/) has been released! Although there are no
major security features in this release, there are quite a few smaller
enhancements and useful additions. Below, I have enumerated the enhancements
which I think are most interesting. I have also grouped them into appropriate
categories (TLS, crypto, etc) which should make it easier to find out what has
changed in each specific area.

#### Crypto

1.  New HmacPBE Mac algorithm support
 
    New standard HmacPBE algorithms have been added to the Standard Algorithm
    Names specification and are implemented in the `SunJCE` provider:
    HmacPBESHA1, HmacPBESHA224, HmacPBESHA256, HmacPBESHA384, HmacPBESHA512,
    HmacPBESHA512/224, and HmacPBESHA512/256. These are used by the PKCS12
    `KeyStore` JDK implementation, but now can also be used independently in
    your applications as `javax.crypto.Mac` algorithms, ex:

        Mac mac = Mac.getInstance("HmacPBESHA256");

    More information: <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/specs/security/standard-names.html#mac-algorithms>

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8215450>

2.  More informative Cipher.toString()
 
    The `toString` method of `javax.crypto.Cipher` has been overridden to print
    more useful information such as the algorithm, mode, and provider used by
    the `Cipher` object, ex:

        Cipher.AES/GCM/NoPadding, mode: encryption, algorithm from: SunJCE

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8210838>
 
3.  PKCS12 KeyStore configuration properties

    New system and security properties have been added for customizing the
    security algorithms used in the PKCS12 `KeyStore` implementation. This
    includes algorithms and parameters for key protection, certificate
    protection, and MacData. For example, there is a property named
    `keystore.pkcs12.certProtectionAlgorithm` that specifies the algorithm that
    is used to encrypt a certificate. More details, including the default values
    for these properties are listed in the `java.security` configuration file.

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8076190>

#### TLS

1.  ChaCha20 and Poly1305 TLS Cipher Suites

    Support for the ChaCha20 and Poly1305 TLS cipher suites has been added to
    the `SunJSSE` provider. The TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 cipher is
    for TLS 1.3 and the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256,
    TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256, and 
    TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 ciphers are for TLS 1.2.
    Each of these ciphers is enabled by default.

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8140466>

2.  New methods to access the SSLSession

    A `getSSLSession` method has been added to the
    `javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection` and `java.net.SecureCacheResponse`
    APIs. This method allows applications to obtain full details of the
    underlying TLS session, such as the negotiated TLS version, which can
    be very useful. This information was not previously available from these
    APIs.

    More information:
      * <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/javax/net/ssl/HttpsURLConnection.html#getSSLSession()>
      * <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/java/net/SecureCacheResponse.html#getSSLSession()>

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8212261>

3.  Anon and NULL cipher suites disabled by default

    The TLS anon (anonymous) and NULL cipher suites have been added to the 
    `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms` security property and are now disabled by
    default. These ciphers have known security risks and should only be used
    in special cases. Note that these ciphers were not previously enabled by
    default (applications still had to explicitly enable them to use them,
    for example by calling `SSLSocket.setEnabledCipherSuites()`). With this
    change, these ciphers are no longer available without additional
    configuration by a user or administrator via the
    `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms` security property.

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8211883>

4.  DES cipher suites disabled by default

    All TLS cipher suites that use DES have been added to the
    `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms` security property and are now disabled by
    default. DES has known security weaknesses and is no longer recommended.
    Note that these ciphers were not previously enabled by default. With this
    change, these ciphers are no longer available without additional
    configuration by a user or administrator via the 
    `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms` security property.

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8208350>

5.  Symantec TLS Server Certificates to be distrusted

    The JDK will stop trusting TLS Server certificates issued by Symantec. The
    list of affected certificates includes certificates branded as GeoTrust,
    Thawte, and VeriSign, which were managed by Symantec. TLS Server
    certificates issued on or before April 16, 2019 will continue to be
    trusted until they expire. Certificates issued after that date will be
    rejected. See the
    [release note](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8215012)
    for more information and a list of Certificate Authorities that are
    affected.

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8207258>

6.  Removed TLS v1 and v1.1 from required algorithms

    TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer required to be implemented by Java SE
    implementations.

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8214140>

7.  TLS 1.2 support for SunPKCS11 provider

    The `SunPKCS11` provider now supports TLS 1.2. TLS 1.2 algorithms for
    key and MAC derivation have been added to the `SunPKCS11` provider.

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8029661>

#### Tools

1.  New keytool -groupname option

    A new `-groupname` option has been added to the `keytool -genkeypair`
    command so that a user can specify a named group when generating a key
    pair. For example:

        keytool -genkeypair -keyalg EC -groupname secp384r1

    will generate an EC key pair by using the `secp384r1` curve.

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8213400>

2.  Deprecated the default algorithms for keytool -keyalg

    A warning is now emitted if the `-keyalg` option is not specified with the
    `-genkeypair` or `-genseckey` keytool commands. The current default for
    `-genkeypair` is DSA and `-genseckey` is DES. In a future release, the
    `-keyalg` option will be required.

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8212003>

3.  keytool -printcert now recognizes the -providername option

    The `-providername` option can be useful for inspecting the contents of a
    certificate that is using an algorithm that is not supported by the
    builtin JDK security providers.

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8201290>

#### SecurityManager

1.  Pure-Java implementation of AccessController.doPrivileged

    The implementation of the `AccessController.doPrivileged` methods are now
    all Java code (they no longer call into the JVM). Micro-benchmarks of
    these methods have shown up to a 50x performance improvement.

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8212605>

2.  New runtime mode for applications that don't use a SecurityManager

    New "disallow" and "allow" token options have been added to the
    `java.security.manager` system property. The "disallow" option can
    improve run-time performance for applications that never set a
    SecurityManager. If the Java Virtual Machine starts with the system
    property `java.security.manager` set to "disallow", then the
    `System.setSecurityManager` method cannot be used to set a security manager
    and will throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`.

    For further details on the behavior of these options, see the
    [class description of `java.lang.SecurityManager`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/SecurityManager.html).

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8191053>

#### Miscellaneous

1.  New Java Flight Recorder (JFR) security events

    New security-related events have been added to the Java Flight Recorder
    tool. These events are disabled by default and can be enabled via JFR
    configuration files or via standard JFR options. See the
    [release note](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8220239)
    for more information on the new events.

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8148188>
