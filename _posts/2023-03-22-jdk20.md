title: JDK 20 Security Enhancements
---

[JDK 20](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/20/) was released on March 21, 2023! As with
my previous [blogs](https://seanjmullan.org/blog/), I
have compiled a list of what I think are the most interesting and useful
security enhancements in this release.  I have also grouped
them into appropriate categories (crypto, TLS, etc) which should make
it easier to find out what has changed in each specific area.
The [JDK 20 release notes](https://jdk.java.net/20/release-notes)
also contain further details on these and other enhancements.

Highlights of this release include further improvements that strengthen
the default security of the Java Platform, improved crypto performance, and
new JFR events for security monitoring.

One other important JDK 20 feature that is related to security but not part
of the security libraries area is the introduction of new system and security
properties to control what object factory classes are allowed to reconstruct
Java objects from JNDI/LDAP and JNDI/RMI contexts. See the
[release note](https://jdk.java.net/20/release-notes#JDK-8290368) for
more details on these new properties.

### General

-   __New InvalidParameterException constructors that take cause as a parameter__

    New constructors have been added to the
    [`InvalidParameterException`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/security/InvalidParameterException.html)
    API that take a cause (`Throwable`) as a parameter. This provides a more
    convenient option than having to separately call the `initCause` method.

    For example, you can now throw an `InvalidParameterException` as:

    ```
        throw new InvalidParameterException(new NullPointerException())
    ```

    or:

    ```
        throw new InvalidParameterException("parameter is null", new NullPointerException())
    ```

    Issue: [JDK-8296226](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8296226)

-   __New service attributes added to the Standard Algorithm Names specification__

    Four additional service attributes have been added to the [Service Attributes section](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/specs/security/standard-names.html#service-attributes) of the Java Security Standard Algorithm Names
    specification. The attributes are `SupportedKeyClasses`,
    `SupportedKeyFormats`, `SupportedModes`, and `SupportedPaddings`. These
    attributes were previously defined and used in the JDK security providers,
    but had not been defined as standard attributes until now.

    Issue: [JDK-8297161](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8297161)

-   __An error is now thrown if the java.security file fails to load__

    An `InternalError` is now thrown at runtime if a security property is
    retrieved but the `java.security` file does not exist or fails to load.
    Prior to this change, if there was a problem loading the `java.security`
    file, a subset of critical properties with hard-coded defaults was used.
    However, this workaround required continual maintenance of the hard-coded
    defaults to ensure they were adequate and more importantly concealed a
    potentially serious issue of a problematic configuration.

    If this issue occurs, you will see an exception stack trace like the following:

    ```
        Exception in thread "main" java.lang.InternalError: Error loading java.security file
        	at java.base/java.security.Security.initialize(Security.java:105)
        	at java.base/java.security.Security.lambda$static$0(Security.java:84)
        	at java.base/java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(AccessController.java:319)
        	at java.base/java.security.Security.<clinit>(Security.java:83)
                ...
    ```

    Issue: [JDK-8155246](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8155246)

### Crypto

-   __Crypto performance related improvements__

    Several performance related improvements have been made in the crypto
    area. Below are details on each of the more significant improvements
    and a pointer to the corresponding issue.
    

    -   __ChaCha20 intrinsics for x86_64 and aarch64 platforms__

        The [SunJCE](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/security/oracle-providers.html#GUID-A47B1249-593C-4C38-A0D0-68FA7681E0A7) provider implementation of the [ChaCha20](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/specs/security/standard-names.html#cipher-algorithms) [Cipher](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/javax/crypto/Cipher.html) algorithm now
        provides an optimized intrinsic for x86_64 and aarch64 platforms, yielding
        a significant improvement in performance. These optimized routines are
        designed for x86_64 chipsets that support the AVX, AVX2 and/or AVX512
        instruction sets, and aarch64 chips that support the Advanced SIMD
        instruction set. The intrinsics are enabled by default on the supported
        platforms, but can be disabled by providing the
        `-XX:-UseChaCha20Intrinsics` command-line option to Java. Flags that
        control intrinsics require the option` -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions`.

        Issue: [JDK-8247645](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8247645)

    -   __Poly1305 intrinsics for ByteBuffers__

        The x86_64 intrinsic for the SunJCE provider implementation of Poly1305 
        (used as the authenticator for the [ChaCha20](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/specs/security/standard-names.html#cipher-algorithms) `Cipher` algorithm) has been
        enhanced to also apply to `ByteBuffer`s. The intrinsic is now enabled
        for the [`CipherSpi.engineUpdate(byte[], ...)`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/javax/crypto/CipherSpi.html#engineUpdate(byte%5B%5D,int,int)) and
        [`CipherSpi.engineUpdate(ByteBuffer, ...)`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/javax/crypto/CipherSpi.html#engineUpdate(java.nio.ByteBuffer,java.nio.ByteBuffer)) methods.
   
        Issue: [JDK-8297379](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8297379)

    -   __Improved MD5 intrinsics for x86_64 platforms__

        The performance of the [MD5](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/specs/security/standard-names.html#messagedigest-algorithms) [`MessageDigest`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/security/MessageDigest.html) intrinsic for x86_64 platforms
        has been significantly improved. 

        Issue: [JDK-8296548](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8296548)

    -   __Improved EC point multiplication for secp256r1 curve__

        The performance of the elliptic curve point multiplication for the
        secp256r1 curve has been significantly improved by using pre-computed
        tables and more efficient algorithms. This performance improvement
        applies to the [SunEC](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/security/oracle-providers.html#GUID-091BF58C-82AB-4C9C-850F-1660824D5254) security provider.

        Issue: [JDK-8295011](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8295011)

    -   __Improved ECC math operations__

        Improved BigInteger and curve point operations result in a modest
        performance improvement for elliptic curve calculations. This
        performance improvement applies to the [SunEC](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/security/oracle-providers.html#GUID-091BF58C-82AB-4C9C-850F-1660824D5254) security provider.

        Issue: [JDK-8294997](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8294997)

### TLS

-   __DTLS 1.0 is now disabled by default__

    The DTLS 1.0 protocol has been disabled by default, improving out of the
    box security. This protocol has various weaknesses and is no longer
    recommended. See [RFC 8996](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8996) for
    more information.

    Applications should be using the more secure DTLS 1.2 protocol, which is
    supported by the JDK. However, if you encounter issues and need to get
    your application working, you can (at your own risk), re-enable DTLS 1.0
    by removing “DTLSv1.0” from the `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms` security
    property in the `java.security` configuration file.

    Issue: [JDK-8256660](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8256660)

-   __ECDH cipher suites disabled by default__

    The TLS_ECDH cipher suites have been added to the
    `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms` security property and are now disabled by
    default. These ciphers do not preserve forward secrecy and are rarely used
    in practice. Some TLS_ECDH cipher suites are already disabled because they
    use 3DES, RC4, anon, or NULL, which were previously disabled. This action
    disables all remaining ECDH cipher suites.

    However, if you encounter issues and need to get your application working,
    you can (at your own risk), re-enable these cipher suites by removing
    “ECDH” from the `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms` security property in the
    `java.security` configuration file.

    Issue: [JDK-8279164](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8279164)

-   __New APIs for customizing TLS and DTLS named groups__

    Two new APIs have been added which allow applications to customize
    and retrieve the prioritized list of named groups used to negotiate the
    key exchange mechanism in a TLS or DTLS connection:
    [`javax.net.ssl.SSLParameters::setNamedGroups`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/javax/net/ssl/SSLParameters.html#setNamedGroups(java.lang.String[])) and
    [`javax.net.ssl.SSLParameters::getNamedGroups`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/javax/net/ssl/SSLParameters.html#getNamedGroups()).

    An example of setting named groups is the following:

    ```
        SSLParameters params = new SSLParameters();
        params.setNamedGroups(new String[] { "x25519", "secp256r1" });
    ```

    Issue: [JDK-8281236](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8281236)

### Tools

-   __New JFR event for recording initial security properties__

    A new event for recording the initial values of security properties has
    been added to the Java Flight Recorder tool. This is useful for recording
    an initial snapshot of the security configuration. The event is named
    `jdk.InitialSecurityProperty` and is enabled by default. When used together
    with the `jdk.SecurityPropertyModification` event, JFR will record the
    initial and subsequent settings for all security properties, which can
    provide important details of the security environment used by the
    application.

    Below is a sample screenshot of the `jdk.InitialSecurityProperty` event
    and some of the values captured for each of the security properties.

    Issue: [JDK-8292177](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8292177)

-   __New JFR event for security provider usage__

    A new event has been added to the Java Flight Recorder tool for recording
    each time a security provider is accessed. This is useful for recording
    each cryptographic algorithm or service that an application uses, providing
    additional insight into the security of the application. The event is named
    `jdk.SecurityProviderService` and contains three fields for the type of
    service, the algorithm, and the provider name. This event is disabled by
    default but can be enabled via the JFR configuration files or standard
    JFR options.

    Below is a sample screenshot of the `jdk.SecurityProviderService` event
    and some of the values captured for each algorithms requested.
