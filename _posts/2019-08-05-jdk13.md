title: JDK 13 Security Enhancements
---

[JDK 13](https://jdk.java.net/13) has been released! As with my
[JDK 12 blog](https://seanjmullan.org/blog/2019/03/19/jdk12), I
have gathered up a list of the most interesting and useful security
enhancements in this release.  And as before, I have grouped them into
appropriate categories (crypto, TLS, etc) which should make it easier
to find out what has changed in each specific area.
The [JDK 13 Release Notes](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/13-relnote-issues-5460548.html)
also contains details on these and other enhancements.

## Table of Contents

### Crypto

1.  Support for Microsoft Cryptography Next Generation (CNG) API

    On Windows, the
    [`SunMSCAPI` JCE provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/security/oracle-providers.html#GUID-4F1737D6-1569-4340-B140-678C70E63CD5)
    has been enhanced to support
    [CNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_CryptoAPI#Cryptography_API:_Next_Generation). 
    The provider can now load RSA and EC keys in CNG format from Windows
    keystores.  The provider also now supports elliptic curve `Signature`
    algorithms (`SHA1withECDSA`, `SHA256withECDSA`, etc.).

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8026953>

2.  PKCS#11 version 2.40

    The [`SunPKCS11` provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/security/oracle-providers.html#GUID-C4706FFE-D08F-4E29-B0BE-CCE8C93DD940)
    has been updated to
    [PKCS#11 v2.40](https://www.oasis-open.org/standards#pkcs11-base-v2.40).
    This update adds support for additional PKCS#11 mechanisms, attributes,
    key types and adds support for several new algorithms:

        Java Algorithm                     PKCS#11 Mechanism       

        MessageDigest.SHA-512/224          CKM_SHA512_224                     
        MessageDigest.SHA-512/256          CKM_SHA512_256

        Signature.SHA512withDSA            CKM_DSA_SHA512
        Cipher.AES/GCM/NoPadding           CKM_AES_GCM

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8080462>

### TLS

1.  `javax.security.cert` APIs marked for removal

    The deprecated
    [`javax.security.cert` APIs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/javax/security/cert/package-summary.html)
    have been marked for removal and are subject to removal in a future
    release. These APIs exist only to support applications written against
    early versions of the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE), prior to its
    inclusion in JDK 1.4. Applications should use the
    [`java.security.cert` package](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/java/security/cert/package-summary.html)
    instead.

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8160247>

2.  X25519 and X448 Diffie-Hellman elliptic curve support

    The [`SunJSSE` provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/security/oracle-providers.html#GUID-7093246A-31A3-4304-AC5F-5FB6400405E2)
    has been enhanced to support the x25519 and x448 elliptic curve named
    groups with x25519 being the highest preferred group. These curves are
    supported for TLS versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3. The default list of
    named groups is now:

        x25519, secp256r1, secp384r1, secp521r1, x448, 
        sect283k1, sect283r1, sect409k1, sect409r1, sect571k1, sect571r1, 
        secp256k1, ffdhe2048, ffdhe3072, ffdhe4096, ffdhe6144, ffdhe8192

    This order can be overridden using the 
    [`jdk.tls.namedGroups` system property](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/security/java-secure-socket-extension-jsse-reference-guide.html#GUID-A41282C3-19A3-400A-A40F-86F4DA22ABA9).

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8171279>

3.  Stateless Server

    The [`SunJSSE` provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/security/oracle-providers.html#GUID-7093246A-31A3-4304-AC5F-5FB6400405E2)
    now supports stateless sessions, which can significantly improve the
    performance and scalability of a TLS server under large workloads.

    For this release, the feature is not yet enabled by default. On the client
    side, it can be enabled by setting the
    `jdk.tls.client.enableSessionTicketExtension` system property to "true"
    and on the server side, by setting the
    `jdk.tls.server.enableSessionTicketExtension` system property to "true".

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8211018>

4.  Enabled cipher suites order changed to improve security

    The order of the default list of enabled TLS cipher suites has been
    modified with several changes to improve security. See the
    [CSR](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8219545) for full details. 

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8163326>

5.  Server-side cipher suite order now preferred

    The TLS cipher suite selection algorithm has been modified to use the
    server's cipher suite order, rather than the client's.

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8168261>

### GSS-API and Kerberos

1.  Kerberos cross-realm referrals

    Client support for principal name canonicalization and cross-realm
    referrals, as specified in
    [RFC 6806](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6806.html) has been added to the
    Kerberos implementation.

    This feature can greatly simplify usability and configuration in a Kerberos
    environment of multiple realms.

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8215032>

2.  Native GSS-API library on Windows

    A Windows implementation of the GSS-API library has been added to the
    JDK. This provides better interoperability and integration with Windows.
    For example, it can directly read Windows login user credentials.

    This implementation is supported on the client-side only and it is
    not enabled by default. To enable it, set the `sun.security.jgss.native`
    system property to "true".

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6722928>

### SASL

1.  SASL mechanisms can now be restricted

    A new security property named `jdk.sasl.disabledMechanisms` has been
    introduced to allow you to disable SASL mechanisms that you no longer want
    to be used. There are no mechanisms disabled by default. Mechanisms can
    be added to the property in the `java.security` configuration file. Here
    is the definition of the property:

        # Disabled mechanisms for the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)
        #
        # Disabled mechanisms will not be negotiated by both SASL clients and servers.
        # These mechanisms will be ignored if they are specified in the mechanisms argument
        # of `Sasl.createClient` or the mechanism argument of `Sasl.createServer`.
        #
        # The value of this property is a comma-separated list of SASL mechanisms.
        # The mechanisms are case-sensitive. Whitespaces around the commas are ignored.
        #
        # Note: This property is currently used by the JDK Reference implementation.
        # It is not guaranteed to be examined and used by other implementations.
        #
        # Example:
        #   jdk.sasl.disabledMechanisms=PLAIN, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5
        jdk.sasl.disabledMechanisms=

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8200400>

### XML Signature

1.  String constants for Canonical XML 1.1

    New public constants named `INCLUSIVE_11` and `INCLUSIVE_11_WITH_COMMENTS`
    have been added to the `javax.xml.crypto.dsig.CanonicalizationMethod` API.
    These represent
    [the URIs for the Canonical XML 1.1 and Canonical XML 1.1 with Comments algorithms](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core1/#sec-Canonical11)
    for XML Signature. Now you can use the constants instead of the URIs in
    your application, ex:

        TransformService.getInstance(CanonicalizationMethod.INCLUSIVE_11);

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8224767>

2.  `javax.xml.crypto.dsig.keyinfo.KeyValue.EC_TYPE` constant  

    A new public constant (`EC_TYPE`) representing
    [the URI of the `ECKeyValue` element](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core1/#sec-ECKeyValue)
    has been added to the `javax.xml.crypto.dsig.keyinfo.KeyValue` API.
    This allows you to identify this type in your applications using the
    constant instead of the URI.

    Issue: <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8223053>

### Tools

1.  keytool command for displaying TLS configuration information

    The `keytool` utility has a new command (`-showinfo` is the command and
    `-tls` is the option) that displays information about the TLS configuration
    of the system that the command is run on. This information includes a list
    of the enabled protocols and cipher suites, ordered by priority.

    Here is an example output of running the command:

        $ keytool -showinfo -tls
